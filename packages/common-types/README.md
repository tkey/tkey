[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tkey/common-types?label=%22%22)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/common-types/v/latest)                      [![minzip](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@tkey/common-types?label=%22%22)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@tkey/common-types@latest) 

Common Types in `tKey` is used to get the access to common types and interfaces of the `tKey` SDK. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.  

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/common-types
```
