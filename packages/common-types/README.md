Common Types in `tKey` is used to get the access to common types and interfaces of the `tKey` SDK. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/common-types
```

### Checkout the [tKey SDK](https://github.com/tkey/tkey)
