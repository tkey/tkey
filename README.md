tKey is the underlying SDK used to implement [Web3Auth Plug n Play](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth). This package can also be used to self host Web3Auth in your own system. tKey stands for Threshold Key, which refers to the management keys & shares generated using threshold cryptography.

## The `tKey` SDK

The `tKey` SDK manages private keys by generating shares of it using Shamir Secret Sharing. For example, for a 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, we give the
user three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC.

- **ShareA** is stored on the user‚Äôs device: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
  in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareB** is managed and split across Web3Auth's Auth Network, accessed by an OAuth login provider that a user owns.
- **ShareC** is a recovery share: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
  enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key.

## Building the SDK Locally

### Requirements

- This package requires a peer dependency of `@babel/runtime`
- Node 18+

### Installation

```
npm install
npm run pack:lerna
```

## Bundling

Each sub package is distributed in 3 formats

- `esm` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.esm.js` in es6 format
- `commonjs` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.cjs.js` in es5 format
- `umd` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.umd.min.js` in es5 format without polyfilling corejs minified

By default, the appropriate format is used for your specified usecase
You can use a different format (if you know what you're doing) by referencing the correct file

The cjs build is not polyfilled with core-js.
It is upto the user to polyfill based on the browserlist they target

### Directly in Browser

CDN's serve the non-core-js polyfilled version by default. You can use a different

jsdeliver

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<MODULE_NAME>"></script>
```

unpkg

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/<MODULE_NAME>"></script>
```

### Tips for NUXT

This is a plugin that works [only on the client side](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins/#client-side-only). So please register it as a ssr-free plugin.
